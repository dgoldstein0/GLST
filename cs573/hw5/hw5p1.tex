Problem 1

reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem

We reduce the problem to a bipartite directed graph matching.

Let $n$ be the number of boxes. Let $G=(V\cup V',E)$ be a bipartite graph, where $V=\{v_{1}, v_{2}...,v_{n}\}$, $V'=\{v'_{1}, v'_{2}...,v'_{n}\}$,  $E=\{(v_{i},v'_{j})\left| $box j can be placed inside box i$\}$. Let $M$ be a matching of G. Every edge in $M$ corresponds to nesting two boxes. Thus a vertex $v'_{j} \in V'$ that is not covered by $M$ indicates that box $j$ is not inside another box, i.e. it is a visible box. Thus the number of visible boxes is $n-\left|M\right|$. Therefore the smallest number of visible boxes is given by ($n-$the maximum matching of G). Thus the algorithm follows

boxNexsting(box[1..n])

\ construct a bipartite graph $G$ as described above

\ compute the maximum matching $M$ of $G$

\ return $n-\left|M\right|$

\

Analysis:
We could use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to compute the maximun matching. The algortihm runs in $O(VE)$. By construction, $\left|V\right|=O(n)$, $\left|E\right|=O(n^{2})$, thus the total running time is $O(n^{3})$.
