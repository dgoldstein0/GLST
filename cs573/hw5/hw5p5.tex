Problem 5

(a)

Proof: Here's Sally's stratrgy

\

GameSally(G,r)

\ run Paul's algorithm GamePaul(G,r), returning path $P$

\ return any edge in $P$

\

Sally will always win since the edge she returns is in $P$, thus $P\cap S\neq \emptyset$

\

(b)

Here's Sally's stratrgy

\

GameSally(G,r)

\ compute a min $(s,t)$-cut $C$ in $G$

\ return $C$

\

Sally will always win since $C$ is a cut. Any path from $s$ to $t$ that Paul computes must include at least one edge in $C$. Thus $P\cap S\neq \emptyset$.

\

(c)

Proof:

Here's Paul's strategy

\

GamePaul(G,r)

\ compute Sally's edge set $S$ by GameSally(G,r)

\ remove $S$ from $G$ to get $G'$

\ return any path $P$ in $G'$

\

The algorithm is correct iff after removing $S$, the remaining graph still has a path from $s$ to $t$. Since $\left|S\right|\leq r < M$, and $M$ is the size of the minimum $(s,t)$-cut, $S$ can't be an $(s,t)$-cut. Therefore, after removing $S$, $s$ and $t$ are still connected. Thus such path does exist.

\

(d)

Here's Sally's stratrgy

\

GameSally(G,r)

\ compute a min $(s,t)$-cut $C$ in $G$

\ if $(r\geq M)$ 

\ \ \ return $C$

\ else 

\ \ \ uniformly randomly choose $r$ edges in $c$

\ \ \ return that subset $C'$

\

Proof:

When $r\geq M$, Sally is gauranteed to win as proved in part (b).

When $r<M$, since $C$ is a minimum $(s,t)$-cut in $G$, then any path Paul choose will have at least one edge in $C$. When we uniformly randomly choose $r$ edges from $C$, the probability that we hit that edge is $\frac{r}{\left|C\right|}=\frac{r}{M}$. Thus the probalility that Sally wins is at least $\frac{r}{M}$ in this case.

Therefore the probability that Sally wins is $min(\frac{r}{M},1)$.

(e)


Here's Paul's strategy

\

GamePaul(G,r)

\ compute a min $(s,t)$-cut $C$ in $G$

\ uniformly randomly choose an edge $e\in C$

\ remove $(C-\{e\})$ from $G$ to get $G'$

\ compute all paths from $s$ to $t$ in $G'$

\ uniformly randomly choose one path and return

\

I don't know of a proof for the winning probability.
