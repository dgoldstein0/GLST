Problem 3

Let $e_{i}$ be the edge we choose in the ith iteration during the greedy algorithm. Now look at the algorithm at the ith iteration, when $i\leq n-1$. At the beginning of the ith iteration, we have already visited $i$ node, thus there are $n-i$ edges to choose. We choose $e_{i}$ because it has the minimal weight among this $n-i-1$ edges. Since the weight of the edges are assigned uniformly and independently from the interval $[0,1]$, 

\begin{array}{lcl}
Pr($e_{i}=x$)&=&Pr($other n-i-1 edges has weight greater than x$)\\&=&(1-x)^{n-i-1}
\end{array}

Thus, for $i\leq n-1$,

\begin{array}{lcl}
    E[w(e_{i})]&=&\int_{0}^{1} x(1-x)^{n-i-1}\\&=& \frac{1}{(n-i-1)^2+3(n-i-1)+2}\\&=&\frac{1}{n-i}-\frac{1}{n-i+1}
\end{array}

At the last iteration, we have to choose the edge back to the first node. The weight of the the edge is random, thus $E[w(e_{n})]=\frac{1}{2}$

Therefore , the expected weight of the whole Hamiltonian path is 

\begin{array}{lcl}
E[path]&=&E[\sum_{i=1}^{n}w(e_{i})]\\&=&\sum_{i=1}^{n}E[w(e_{i})]\\&=&\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\frac{1}{n-i}-\frac{1}{n-i+1}+\frac{1}{2}\\$=$\frac{3}{2}-\frac{1}{n}
\end{array}
