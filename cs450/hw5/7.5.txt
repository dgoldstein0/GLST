(c)
The cubic spline give more reasonable resullt.
The single 5-degree interpolation will results in a curve with more 
oscillation due to the nature of a relatively high degree polynomial
The cubic spline is more smooth between data points
(d)
No. Piecewise linear interpolation is not smooth at the data points
